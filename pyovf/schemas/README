Modifications
-------------
Additionally, modifications have been made the original files, as follows:


In CIM_ResourceAllocationSettingData.xsd and CIM_VirtualSystemSettingData.xsd
files, there were three definitions of

	<xs:restriction base="cim:cimAnySimpleType">

libxml2 failed to parse the schemas with these lines, however they did parse after
modifying them to:

	<xs:restriction base="xs:anyType">

--- modify ovf-envelope.xsd for local xml.xsd schema ---
change
    <xs:import namespace="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd"/>
to
    <xs:import namespace="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" schemaLocation="xml.xsd"/>
